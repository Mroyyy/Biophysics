# Biophysics

Here is the source code for an exercise about the **evaluation energy Spike RBD-ACE2 protein-protein interface analysis** using Jupyter-notebook. The objective of this project was to evaluate the contribution of each of the interface residues to the interaction energy in a specific protein-protein complex. 

## Index

## Preparation

From the PDB load the structure **6m0J**, which corresponds to the **Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound with ACE2**. Since we want only to know how interface residues contribute to the complex, we will perform a quality checking on the structure: add missing side-chains and
hydrogen atoms and atom charges. This 'pre-step' will be performed with the file named **'check_structure.ipynb'**.
