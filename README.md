# Biophysics

Here is the source code for an exercise about the **evaluation energy Spike RBD-ACE2 protein-protein interface analysis** using Jupyter-notebook. The objective of this project was to evaluate the contribution of each of the interface residues to the interaction energy in a specific protein-protein complex. 

## Index

## Preparation

From the PDB load the structure **6m0J**, which corresponds to the **Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain bound with ACE2**. Since we want only to know how interface residues contribute to the complex, we will perform a quality checking on the structure: add missing side-chains and
hydrogen atoms and atom charges. This 'pre-step' will be performed with the file named **'check_structure.ipynb'**. 
The following are the results before running the script and after. If we observe closely we'll se that at first the number of heteroatoms, ligands or water molecules were several, and after cleaning the structure, to obtain the biological unit, we removed them.
